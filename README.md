## Abstract

We perform the first iterative Monte Carlo (IMC) analysis of fragmentation functions constrained 
by all available data from single-inclusive e+e- annihilation into pions and kaons. The IMC method 
eliminates potential bias in traditional analyses based on single fits introduced by fixing parameters 
not well constrained by the data and provides a statistically rigorous determination of uncertainties. 
Our analysis reveals specific features of fragmentation functions using the new IMC methodology and 
those obtained from previous analyses, especially for light quarks and for strange quark fragmentation 
to kaons.
