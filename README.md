## About
 
The repository contains interpolation tables for the collinear parton
distribution functions in the nucleon, and the collinear parton to hadron
fragmentation functions. The interpolation codes and grids are available in:

* [python](https://github.com/QCDHUB/JAM16/tree/master/python)

* [LHAPDF format](https://github.com/QCDHUB/JAM16/tree/master/LHAPDF) (grids only)

* [fortran](https://github.com/QCDHUB/JAM16/tree/master/fortran)

The usage is described in the README files within each subfolder.
